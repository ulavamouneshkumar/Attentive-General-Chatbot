Attentive General Chatbot using Deep Learning
---------------------------------------------
This is a chatbot built using Deep Learning techniques to provide a more personalized and engaging experience to users. It is trained on a small dataset of intents and their corresponding responses, which are used to predict the appropriate response for a given user.
---------------------------------------------

Prerequisites:
---------------------------------------------
•Python 3.6 or later
•TensorFlow 2.x or later
•Keras 2.x or later
•NumPy
•Scikit-learn
•Pickle
•Matplotlib
•Colorama
---------------------------------------------


Installation:
---------------------------------------------
To install the required packages, run the following command:
pip install <package_name>
---------------------------------------------


Files:
---------------------------------------------
The project contains the following files:
•gui.py - The main file that contains the code for the chatbot. It contains chatbot GUI application using tkinter,PIL libraries and chatbot module.
•bot.py - This file defines a chatbot using a neural network with an attention mechanism. It trains on intents defined in intents.json and predicts responses based on user input.
•intents.json - A JSON file that contains the training data of 60 tags for the chatbot.
---------------------------------------------


How to run:
---------------------------------------------
•You can run gui.py file directly to chat with the chatbot. It contains a python code for a chatbot application with a graphical user interface using Tkinter and PIL libraries. It includes a chat window where users can type their messages and receive responses from the bot. The code also saves the chat log with a timestamped filename upon closing the window in your respective directory of your project.
---------------------------------------------


 By modifying the contents of the intents.json file, we can customize the chatbot's responses to better suit our needs and provide more appropriate replies to user queries.
